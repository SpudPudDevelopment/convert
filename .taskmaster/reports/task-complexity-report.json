			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Electron Application Framework with React",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Electron and React setup task into subtasks covering: 1) Project initialization and dependency installation, 2) Main process configuration, 3) Renderer process and React setup, 4) IPC communication implementation, and 5) Development environment configuration with hot reloading.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up the foundational architecture for the entire application with multiple technologies (Electron, React, webpack). It requires configuration of both main and renderer processes, IPC communication, and development tooling. The complexity comes from integrating these technologies correctly and ensuring they work together seamlessly."

		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Implement File System Operations",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the File System Operations task into subtasks covering: 1) File selection dialogs and drag-and-drop implementation, 2) File reading and writing core functionality, 3) Temporary workspace management, 4) Output directory and file naming management, 5) File metadata handling, and 6) Error handling and recovery mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex file system operations with multiple edge cases to handle (permissions, file conflicts, cleanup). It requires implementing both UI components for file selection and backend services for file operations. The task also needs to handle temporary files, metadata preservation, and robust error handling across different file types and scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Core UI Components",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Core UI Components task into subtasks covering: 1) Main application layout and navigation structure, 2) File input and drag-and-drop components, 3) Conversion settings panels with contextual controls, 4) Progress indicators and job queue display, 5) Output configuration UI components, and 6) Theme support and accessibility implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a comprehensive UI system with multiple interactive components that need to work together cohesively. It requires implementing complex UI patterns like drag-and-drop, contextual panels, progress tracking, and ensuring accessibility. The components must also support theming and be responsive to window resizing, adding to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Conversion Job Management System",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Conversion Job Management System task into subtasks covering: 1) Job data model implementation, 2) Job queue and scheduling system, 3) Progress tracking and status updates, 4) Resource management for concurrent conversions, 5) Job cancellation and error recovery, 6) Job history management, and 7) Conversion presets implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it forms the core processing pipeline of the application. It requires implementing a robust job management system with queuing, progress tracking, resource allocation, and error handling. The system must coordinate between UI components and conversion engines while managing state across the application. It also needs to handle concurrency and resource constraints."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Document Conversion Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Document Conversion Engine task into subtasks covering: 1) PDF.js integration for PDF handling, 2) Mammoth.js integration for DOCX handling, 3) PDF to DOCX conversion pipeline, 4) DOCX to PDF conversion pipeline, 5) Text extraction and plain text conversion, and 6) Formatting preservation and metadata handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple third-party libraries to handle different document formats and creating reliable conversion pipelines between them. The complexity comes from ensuring formatting preservation, handling document metadata, and managing the conversion process for potentially large documents. Error handling for malformed documents adds additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Image Conversion Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Image Conversion Engine task into subtasks covering: 1) Sharp library integration for image processing, 2) Format conversion between JPG, PNG, and WEBP, 3) Quality and resize options implementation, 4) Metadata and transparency handling, and 5) Batch processing and progress reporting.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires integrating the Sharp library and implementing various image processing operations. While less complex than document conversion, it still involves handling different image formats, preserving transparency where applicable, managing metadata, and implementing various quality and size options. Batch processing and memory optimization for large images add to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Preferences and Presets System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the User Preferences and Presets System task into subtasks covering: 1) User preferences data model and storage implementation, 2) Conversion presets management system, 3) Recent jobs tracking and history management, and 4) Preferences UI integration and import/export functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a system to persistently store and manage user preferences and conversion presets. While moderately complex, it's more straightforward than some other tasks as it primarily involves data management and storage. The complexity comes from ensuring preferences are correctly applied across the application and implementing import/export functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Audio Conversion with FFmpeg",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Basic Audio Conversion task into subtasks covering: 1) FFmpeg integration and binary management for macOS, 2) Audio conversion pipelines for MP3, WAV, and AAC, 3) Audio settings implementation (bitrate, sample rate, channels), 4) Metadata preservation and progress reporting, and 5) Error handling and resource management.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating FFmpeg for audio processing, which adds complexity due to binary management and process handling. Creating reliable conversion pipelines between different audio formats with various quality settings requires careful implementation. Managing FFmpeg processes efficiently and handling errors appropriately adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Video Conversion with FFmpeg",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Basic Video Conversion task into subtasks covering: 1) Extending FFmpeg integration for video processing, 2) Video conversion pipelines for MP4 and MOV, 3) Video and audio settings implementation (resolution, bitrate, frame rate), 4) Progress tracking and cancellation support, and 5) Resource optimization and error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Video conversion is more complex than audio conversion due to the additional parameters involved (resolution, frame rate, etc.) and the larger file sizes. It requires careful resource management to handle potentially long-running conversions and significant memory usage. The task also needs to handle both video and audio streams within the video files, adding another layer of complexity."
